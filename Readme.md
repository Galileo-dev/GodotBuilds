# Archiving
📦 Godot have started making daily builds themeselves for version 4 and so this project is now not needed!
# Daily Godot Builds
🚀 This project uses GitHub Actions to create daily builds of the latest version of the Godot game engine, before the official releases become available. Through this project, I gained experience with:

- CI/CD pipelines
- Cross-compilation
- GitHub Actions

🎮 The Godot game engine can be found at the following link: https://github.com/godotengine/godot

💻 Currently, this project supports building for Windows.

🔮 In the future, I plan to expand support to include Linux.

⚠️ There is currently an issue with cross-compiling for Windows due to an `idx-factory` error. This issue is being actively investigated and a solution is being sought.

## Known Issues
- Cannot cross-compile for Windows due to `idx-factory` error
